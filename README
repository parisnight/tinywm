The focus was not working with Firefox.  Mouse right click, the upper right hamburger,
and alt menu pulldowns didn't work.. they would open for an instant then disappear.

I have added a focus into the alt-F1 raise sequence which allows Firefox to work.
Unfortunately we lose the focus follows mouse of the natural X windows handling.

Usage:

  Focus follows Alt-F1.
  Alt+Button1, drag: interactive window move
  Alt+Button3, drag: interactive window resize
  Alt+F1: raise focused window
  
Please see Nick's original code for further information.
